# Elia Albaba

## About Me
Hola! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Elia (pronounced EL-EE-AH), and I'm a Sophomore at the University of Akron majoring in Computer Science. So far I can't put my finger on a specific area of Computer Science that I like most. I am interested with everything from Computer System Architecture, to the Operating System and the Hardware-Software interface, Algorithms and time complexicy analysis, or even something as high-level as Object-Oriented Programming and UML. I am excited to keep learning about Computer Science and appreciate all the intricate hard work that was done before me.

## Experience
Although my experience is limited, I am committed to pushing my boundaries, embracing challenges, and continuously striving for improvement in my coding journey.
### Robotics Club
During my time in Hoover High School in North Canton, I was a part of a team in designing and building an embedded system with fully autonomous and manual modes to accomplish intricate tasks efficiently. The robot was tasked to be able to go around the field, pickup balls of the correct color and shoot them into the goal. In order to do this, the robot had to use its vision system to calculate the distance to the goal and given a specific angle, figure out the best speed to launch the ball to get it in the hoop. The robot was supposed to be able to do all of this autonomously as well as introduce a manual mode (but still aided by the robot).

I was in charge of programming the [vision system](https://github.com/FRC-4121/4121-Vision) in **Python**, but I also helped design the main [drive train program](https://github.com/FRC-4121/2022-Robot-V2) in **Java**. This opportunity was considered a simulated work environment that taught me to have good teamwork and problem-solving skills since I had to work with the Mechanical and Electrical teams to design this robot from scratch.


### Projects

- Web Scraping application
    - Using **Python**, I wrote a program that would dynamically open a list of websites and do a specific task.
    - Used **Selenium** and **Beautiful Soup** libraries in Python.
    - Specifically I was using this tool to open multiple vine.com links trying to see if there's any potential vines that still exist out there.
- [Source Facts](https://github.com/Thenewchicken55/SourceFax)
    - Generate facts about the source code. A big piece of code (such as a Linux distribution) converted to XML, using a program called srcML, gets broken down efficiently and generate facts about the source code, such as number of lines of code, files, classes, functions, etc.
    - The purpose of the project is to take this complicated program and apply OOP characteristics to make the code as reusable and maintainable as possible
    - Written in **C++**
- [RSA Encryption](https://github.com/Thenewchicken55/RSA-encryption-Algorithms-Project)
    - Using **Python**, take a message, convert it to a number using sha256() hashing, and encrypt this number using an RSA algorithm efficiently
- [Simple Linux Shell](https://github.com/Thenewchicken55/Simple-Linux-Shell)
    - Using **C**, this program simulates a shell by reading in user input to the console and executing specific functionality similar to Linux commands. As a matter of fact, on top of the custom commands, this program allows you to run Linux commands as well.
- (WIP) CLI-GUI
    - A GUI on top of Linux command-line where it has buttons that paste a specific command into the console. This can be done as a shortcut to save time, or a suggestion feature could be implemented where the program tries to predict the next command that the user might send, and clicking the button will save the user that much time.

### Programming Languages:
I am constantly learning new languages, but so far I have used these languages in projects in order from most familiar to least:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- C
- C#
- HTML/CSS
